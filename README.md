# Gym Robotics (Under development)

Gym robotics is a collection of reinforcement learning environments specifically for robotics tasks.  This repo is currently under development. We plan to provide a common interface for robot learning in the real world and in simulation (Pybullet, MuJoCo). For an idea of what we are trying to do (but better), please see this [gym environment for Baxter](https://github.com/jmichaux/gym-baxter).
